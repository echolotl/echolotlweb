Alleon Forest, just south of Mount Salto, is our town's most nearby forest and the main source of our lumber. Knowing this information, I stand by my opinion that we shouldn't be destroying it bit-by-bit for our own needs. So many who wish to destroy it have never stepped foot in the forest, either because they have no reason to or they believe all of the tall tales being told in the town square. However, being who I am, I often venture through the forest. Thus, I know what could be lost if this continues. 

The diversity in this forest is unlike any forest I have ever stepped foot into. The number of variants of trees and flora is remarkable! It's as if a rainbow had descended upon it and painted its pattern across the treetops... not to mention the other rainbow of flowers placed upon the floor! The number of species littering the ground and above is also breathtaking! At least for me. Tininsects that I had never seen before in the flesh, such as the Tyhick!

Creatures like these alone deserve to have a home to live in... especially since this is the only region where they live.

But, other than than the flora and tinisects... I can agree with the townsfolk. This forest is very eerie, especially when walking under the treetops. Little light gets through, even during the height of the Sola. There's only one actual trail through the forest, and since no one ventures inside to light the lanterns placed along it, even it is hard to follow. The worst part, though, is that there are long trails of webbing strung around, with silk as thick as a small rope. I, personally, don't know of any tinisect that would be able to produce anything like it. Also, I guess the storytellers are correct in one part; it always feels like there could be someone watching. However, I haven't seen anything myself. 

No matter, I will continue to try my hardest to convince them that this sanctuary of life shouldn't be torn apart.
