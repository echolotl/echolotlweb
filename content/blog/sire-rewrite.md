If you haven't noticed by the slight redesign of the site, it has been completely **rewritten from the ground up**!

I migrated the site from Astro to Nuxt 3, (moving to Vue in the process) and also moved from a database-driven system to a file based system. This doesn't mean much for you, the user, but it means that I can add new blogs and art quicker and without having to build giant systems to do so. (I super overengineered the last site, and it was a pain to work with.)

Nuxt is super cool and easy to use (if anyone cares), and I leaned towards it because I had been using Vue for *Fridaylight*. 

## Character Pages

The [main characters page](/characters) has been changed, and has these new fun cards which have a character image than kinda pops out at you.

::callout{type="error" title="Note"}
Most characters still don't have their assets for their pages (including icons!) created as of writing.

The individual character pages also have a new infobox design, if you care.

## Art Galleries

The art galleries on both character pages and the main art page have been changed, with badges showing if they're a sketch or character art, and if they're pinned when not on the main art page. On the main art page, there's also a couple of filters, which will be expanded upon at some point.

Plenty of new art has been added, too! Check out the [Art Archive](/art) to see it all.

## Blog Posts and Art Pages

Both the blog posts and art pages have been redesigned, with a new layout that is more consistent and easier to read. The blog posts now support different authors.

That is about all for those pages lol.

## Mobile Design

The navbar actually works on mobile now, featuring a hamburger menu!

Okay, I think that's all that's been changed. I hope you like some of the new stuff!!
